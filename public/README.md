Place static assets here to be served as-is by Vite.

Recommended:
- Logo at `public/academix-logo.png` (used by the navbar as `/academix-logo.png`).
- Social images, favicons, and any files you want accessible via absolute paths.

Notes:
- Files in `public/` are not processed by the bundler; reference them with `/filename.ext`.
- For images imported inside components (so you can tree-shake and hash), use `src/assets/`.
